CS 159 introduces the tools of software development that have become essential for innovative and creative problem 
solving in science and engineering. Educators and employers agree that it is important for future scientific and 
engineering professionals to be able to function as part of a technical team and develop the ability to communicate 
complex technical concepts. CS 159 will require students to work in assigned teams for lab assignments. Educational 
research informs us that structured collaboration leads to increased learning gains for all students participating in an 
introductory programming course. Collaboration is a requirement of the course. You will be assigned to your teams by 
your instructor. 

CS 159 explores the concepts of programming using a language and development environment that are new to most 
students. One objective of the course is to help students recognize how programming concepts are common to various 
languages to which you are exposed in your undergraduate education and how those concepts can be used to solve a 
problem.

CS 159 is an introductory programming course without official prerequisite but does assume mathematical and physical 
science knowledge and sophistication typical of a first-year engineering student. 

The University expects students to invest 6-9 hours per week in preparation, in addition to time spent in class, for a three 
credit hour course. Previous students in CS 159 have reported that their keys to success included attending lecture, active 
participation in lab, preparation and regular review of course materials, and planning to start and complete all assignments 
well in advance of the due date.
